\begin{abstract}
These proceedings serve as a comprehensive record of the research contributions and discussions presented at the International Workshop on Compilers and Optimization Techniques for Edge AI (CODAI) in both 2022 and 2023. CODAI, held in conjunction with the Embedded Systems Week conference series, is an annual event that provides a vibrant platform for researchers, experts, and practitioners to converge and exchange insights in the dynamic field of Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI). The workshop explores a wide range of topics, including compilers for Edge AI, optimization techniques, hardware backends, and applications for embedded AI accelerators.

The papers featured in these proceedings encompass novel approaches, innovative methodologies, and practical solutions for deploying AI on edge devices. Researchers from both academic and industrial backgrounds present their findings, highlighting advancements in AI compiler technology and its impact on real-world applications. CODAI fosters collaboration between academia and industry, making it a vital resource for staying at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field.

These proceedings provide a valuable resource for those seeking to understand the latest developments in Edge AI compilers and optimization techniques. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the authors, reviewers, and participants whose contributions have not only enriched the CODAI workshop but have also made significant contributions to the broader field of Edge AI.
